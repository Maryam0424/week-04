TASK 1:
The Python script enables an auction set up by collecting essential details for each item to be auctioned. The `setup_auction()` function prompts the user to input item information, including item number, description, and reserve price, ensuring a minimum of 10 items are entered. Input validation ensures the reserve price is a positive number. The script also features a testing function, `test_setup_auction()`, which confirms the setup's success by verifying that at least 10 items are recorded. The script streamlines the auction setup process while enhancing reliability through automated testing.
TASK 2:
The Python program enables a bidding system for buyers to view and bid on auction items. It utilizes a dictionary to store item details, including description, current highest bid, and number of bids. The `view_items()` function displays these details, while `place_bid()` allows buyers to enter bids, ensuring they exceed previous bids. If successful, the bid updates the current highest bid and increments the number of bids for the item. Overall, the program offers a user-friendly interface for buyers to engage in the auction process, ensuring bid integrity through validation checks.
TASK 3:
The provided Python function, `end_auction()`, analyzes the results of an auction based on previously recorded item details. It assesses each item's final bid against its reserve price, categorizing items as sold, below the reserve price, or receiving no bids. For sold items, it calculates the auction company fee (10% of the final bid) and accumulates the total fee. The function then displays essential statistics, including the total auction company fee, the number of items sold, those below the reserve price, and those without bids. This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the auction's performance and outcome.
